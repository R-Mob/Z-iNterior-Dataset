## 📦 What’s Inside?

Each scene in the dataset includes:

- 🖼️ **RGB Render** — Full-color photorealistic render of the scene.
- 🧱 **Albedo Map** — Surface base color without lighting or shading.
- 🧭 **Object-Space Normal Map** — Normals in object coordinate space for geometric cues.
- 🌐 **Tangent-Space Normal Map** — Normals encoded in tangent space, ideal for training neural networks.
- 🌊 **Depth Map** — Accurate depth information from the camera's perspective.
- 📄 **Per-sample JSON Metadata** — Camera parameters, scene transforms, and asset-level annotations.

## 🔧 Use Cases

- Indoor scene understanding
- Semantic segmentation
- Surface normal and depth prediction
- Photorealistic rendering model training
- Synthetic-to-real domain adaptation
  

## 📅 Release Timeline

The dataset is currently being finalized and will be publicly released **soon**. Stay tuned for updates!
